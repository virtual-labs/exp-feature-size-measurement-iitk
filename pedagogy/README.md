#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will identify the appropriate region for measurement | Simulator enables moving the samples and magnifying the region of interest.  | Learning of the quantification of microstructural features using SEM images
2.| Obtaining the image with optimal contrast | Controls for focusing and optimizing the contrast  | Setting up of a good quality image
3.| Measuring the tabulating the feature size | Select the tool for measuring the features | Quantifying the features
